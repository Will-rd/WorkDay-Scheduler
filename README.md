based on color coding what part of the schedule is in the past present or future.
- To clear local storage right click in the webpage and click inspect. Then navigate to the applications tab to see what you have stored.
The data can also be cleared from this tab.

## Thank Yous/Collaborations

 - I was assisted by Faran Navazi, a tutor in the bootcamp program I am currently enrolled in. He offered help that got this code far more efficent and pointed me in the right direction.

 ## Updates

 - I intend to create a for loop in the final function call to grab all of the text input in far less lines of code.
